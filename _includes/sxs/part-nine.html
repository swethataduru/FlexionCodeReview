        Never Fear – CDC is Ready

    </h2>
    <p>
If zombies did start roaming the streets, CDC would conduct an investigation much like
any other disease outbreak. CDC would provide technical assistance to cities, states,
or international partners dealing with a zombie infestation. This assistance might
include consultation, lab testing and analysis, patient management and care, tracking
of contacts, and infection control (including isolation and quarantine). It’s likely that an
investigation of this scenario would seek to accomplish several goals: determine the
cause of the illness, the source of the infection/virus/toxin, learn how it is transmitted
and how readily it is spread, how to break the cycle of transmission and thus prevent
further cases, and how patients can best be treated. Not only would scientists be
working to identify the cause and cure of the zombie outbreak, but CDC and other
federal agencies would send medical teams and first responders to help those in
affected areas (I will be volunteering the young nameless disease detectives for the
field work)
