# Flexion Code Review 

This is one of the interesting web design system I have looked at. It was very interesting and the more I was getting into it - the more it made me question so many things. 

I am very excited to discuss some of the issues I faced and what could have been done better and would love to know my missing areas. 

## Tools Used:

HTML5
CSS3
Visual Studio Code (as the code editor)
Git (for version control)

Step 1: Define the Purpose and Structure

First, define the purpose and structure of the website. In this case, we need a home page and an interior page (Preparedness 101). The purpose is to inform the public about preparing for a fictional zombie invasion.

Step 2: Create Wireframes

Design simple wireframes for the home page and the Preparedness 101 page. This helps plan the layout and placement of elements. Sketch the basic structure on paper or use digital tools. 

Step 3: Set Up the Project

Create a project folder for your website and set up the necessary files and directories:

home.html (Home page)
preparedness101.html (Interior page)
login.html
createaccount.html
assets (folder for CSS, images, and JavaScript)

Step 4: Build the Website Structure

In each HTML file (index.html , preparedness101.html, login.html, createaccount.html), structure the basic HTML layout, including header, main content, and footer. Use HTML5 semantic elements for clarity and accessibility.

Step 5: Style the Website

Create a CSS file (e.g., style.css) in the assets folder and link it to both HTML pages. Apply the USWDS framework for a consistent and responsive design. Customize the styles to match the theme of a zombie invasion preparedness site.

Step 6: Add Content

Insert the provided dummy content into the HTML files. Ensure that the content is logically organized and easy to read. Use headings, paragraphs, lists, and other HTML elements as needed.

## Planning and Content Organization:

1) Reviewed the provided dummy content for the website, specifically focusing on the Home Page and the Preparedness 101 interior page.
2) Identified key sections and content elements to structure the website effectively.

Create the Project Folder Structure:
Organize your project into folders for HTML, CSS, JavaScript (if needed), and assets (e.g., images).
Use a code editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text to create and manage your project.

Set Up HTML Templates:
Created an HTML file for the Home Page (home.html) and another for the Preparedness 101 interior page (preparedness101.html).
Use HTML5 semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> for structuring content.

Apply USWDS:
Downloaded the latest version of the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) and include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files in your project.
Refer to the USWDS documentation for guidance on integrating it into your HTML structure.

Design the Website:
Use CSS to style the website according to USWDS guidelines and your creative vision.
Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes (mobile-friendly).

Add Content:
Insert the dummy content into the appropriate sections of your HTML files.
Use headings, paragraphs, lists, and other HTML elements to structure the content logically.

Create Navigation:
Implement navigation menus using USWDS components.
Include links in the header or footer to navigate between the Home Page and Preparedness 101.

## Alternative approach

Content Management System (CMS): Instead of hand-coding the website, we could use a CMS like WordPress to simplify content management and allow non-technical users to update the site.

Frameworks: we could also use web development frameworks like React or Vue.js for building a more dynamic and interactive website, but this might be an overkill for a simple government website.


## Enhanced Improvements

Enhanced Content: Expand the content on the website to cover more aspects of preparedness for the fictitious zombie invasion, including survival strategies, safety tips, and emergency supplies. Make it more informative and engaging.

Interactive Features: Add interactive features like quizzes, games, or scenario-based decision-making exercises to make the website more engaging and educational.

Localization: Consider localizing the website for different regions or languages to reach a broader audience.

Community Engagement: Implement a discussion forum or community section where users can share their own preparedness tips and experiences related to the fictitious crisis.

Accessibility and Usability: Conduct a thorough accessibility audit and usability testing to ensure the website is user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of users, including those with disabilities.

Mobile App Integration: Create a companion mobile app that provides users with real-time updates, notifications, and additional resources related to the fictitious crisis.

Analytics and Metrics: Implement analytics tools to track user engagement, page views, and user feedback. Use this data to make data-driven improvements to the website.

Social Media Integration: Add social media sharing buttons and integration to allow users to share preparedness tips and information easily.

Security: Enhance website security to protect user data and ensure the integrity of the information provided.

Regular Updates: Commit to regularly updating the website's content and resources to keep it relevant and informative.
